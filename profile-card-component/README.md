## My process

- Create the html structure first and make sure to make it as semantic and clean as possible
- Use meaninful class names in your html doc
- Stop and think about all the css styles that could be reusable throughout your project and declare them first. It will help you write less code
- Divide the project into small parts and start working on each of them and make sure to complete it before moving to the next one

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned alot about positioning. Absolute and relative how they work together and how z-index is used to stack elements on the layout.

It was a good practice to learn to better organize my css and html files.

### Useful resources

I completed most of the stuff pretty easily. But I didn't knew much about positioning and z-index which I used to add those pattern and background svgs to the project. That's where these videos came in handy. Kevin explains everything very well make sure to watch it till the end.
